1. Your friend is playing blackjack at a casino, and hits on 18. The next card is a 3, and your
friend wins $500.
The next night, the same situation comes up again, and your friend asks for your advice on
whether to hit or stick. What would you tell her?

Answer: He/she can do what they want after all it is called gambling, but odds are if they are playing with a six card deck and he/she has a soft 18 (Ace, Seven) and there is an 9-Face up they should hit. It provide her with the best odds to win. My assupmtion of a 9-Face comes from the fact that the player originally hit and assuming same hand.
