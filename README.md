Below are the answers to the following questions with example pictures, code, and snipets. Enjoy! (Answers are italicized.) 

1. Your friend is playing blackjack at a casino, and hits on 18. The next card is a 3, and your friend wins $500. The next night, the same situation comes up again, and your friend asks for your advice on whether to hit or stick. What would you tell her?

*In this case it's called gambling for a reason, so she may choose to do what she wants but we can calculate her odds and probability based on a few assumptions listed out below. Her best chance to win is to hit in this situation assuming she has a soft 18 versus a face card. A basic deck has 52 cards, with four suits ranging from Ace to King (An ace can be high 11 or 1 in this situation). The dealer also has a card down and the highest probablility of this is for it to be of value ten (Ten-King) which gives us 30% or 16/52. Based on this we assume that if she hits and gets an ace to 3 she has improved her hand and should stay. The probability of Ace-Three  is 12/52 or 23%. Furthermore if she hits and gets a Face card Ten-King her probability of this is 16/52 or 30%. In that case she has a better than 50% to improve or remain in the same position so her best option is to hit. Eventually we can calcualte the odds of each card in the deck for the player and the dealer.  After calculting her odds and the dealers her best chance is to hit and hope for a win.*

2. A genie has given you a very useful and practical skill- you are able to determine the exact "true talent" level of the Major League team that employs you. On Opening Day, you determine that your team's true talent is that of an 86 win team. Based on this determination, your GM asks you for a range of win totals that you are 95% confident your team will fall into the coming coming season. How would you go about finding this range, and what would yoru answer be? (Assume no inujries or other change of talent, and that your team's "true talent" winning percentage remains constant for all 162 games.)  

*I would approach this by using a 95% confidence interval to determine how accurate my "True Talent" really is at predicting games and how many of those would fall within that interval. From a random sample of data we can determine the win/loss ratio and we can use the 95% confidence interval to come up with a range in which we'd accept our prediction as accurate or not. If it fall's within this area we would indicate that we are 95% confident that the means for the entire population fall within this range. For a model on predicting the win/loss I've seen numerous methods from Mutiple Regression, Logistic Regression, to Factor Analysis used which will help in providing a predictive model. In fairness most models I've built through work at Kohl's or at Associated Bank revolve around testing a variety of variety and models to see which is the best fit and can provide the best explanation for what we are trying to accomplish. This would be a cool exercise to build and try and see how accurate one could get and how best to get there.* 

3. Your GM reads that "Everything You Always wanted to Know About the Times Through the Order Penalty" article by Mitchel Lichtman on Baseball Prosepctus and is greatly influenced by the findings.Two years later, he sees Russell Carleton's article "Is There a Times Through the Order Penatly?" on the same site and asks you to explain how and whether this should affect his belefis. 

*The "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Time Through the Order Penalty" looks be a be a good summarization piece on showcasing that as a batter goes through the order aginst the same pitcher more and more he has a better chance. While I agree with the authors statement and also like the way he laid out some of segments such as top tier pitching and hitters there are alot of other varaibles that can go into this metric to predict what will happen and the effect it will actually have. In Carleton's piece he hits on the more quantitative reasoning and portrays alot of these affects through statistical reasoning, bringing in other variables so that we can determine what has an effect and how much while holding others constant. This mathametical approach is a good one but I woud of liked to have seen a bit more on the estimated impacts as well as accuracy in doing such as there is also some risk of correlation and mis-fitting. Overall I agree with the fact that as a batter goes more through the order against a pitcher he has a beter chance and buidling a model to support such and predict such with a good fit and that which makes sense would be a great way to show this and interpet the other variables that have an effect.*  

4. Imagine you're the manager of the 2016 Brewers and you're faced with the following situation in a game against the Pirates at Miller Park:  It's a tie game with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Jonathan Villar is on third base, and Chris Carter is at the plate facing Mark Melancon. You have Kirk Nieuwenheis and Hernan Perez still available on your bench. What are your options as the magner? Which option provides the best opportunity to win the game? Which oprtion provides the best opportunity to win the game in this at-bat?  
Assumptions

* Jonathan Villar: Young guy, 62 SB
* Chris Carter: R, .211 BA, OBP .313
* Hernan Perez: R, .248 BA, OBP .278, 34 SB
* Kirk Nieuwenheis: L, .218 BA, OBP .332, 8 SB
* Mark Melancon: Throws Right, Career 2.72 ERA

*The above BA and OBP refelct the players 2016 statistics against a righty. Now I'd want to compare a variety of things here from sample size, player, type of pitcher Mark Melancon is, to even a prediction of how well these players would do. But my optoins are a few do I pitch run? With Villar on third even though he's a young guy we'll assume he's got good baserunning instincts and his speed is fine and not an issue. Thought with two outs this isn't the biggest thing we need. We need base-runners or a hit, so that the next option is who should we have at the plate. Chris Carter is currently up and vs. a right hand pticher he has the lowest BA out of the three and second highest OBP. Noticing Kirk Nieuwenheis on the bench and that lefties tend to hit better off Mark M and also the fact that Kirk has the higest OBP we choose to go with Kirk. I did note that Hernan Perez does have a better BA than him but Kirk's OBP is much higher and I like our odds to get a man on and then decide what to do next. As far as best opportunity to win the game in this at-bat, from a sheer average standpoint I go with Hernan Perez as his average against right hand pitching is the highest of all three. Now there are a ton of other variables to take into account and area we could look in but at a quick high level that would be my decision. Let's hope for a win.*
