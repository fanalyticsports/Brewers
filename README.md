1.Your friend is playing blackjack at a casino, and hits on 18. The next card is a 3, and your friend wins $500. The next night, the same situation comes up again, and your friend asks for your advice on whether to hit or stick. What would you tell her?  

*In this case it's called gambling for a reason, so she may choose to do what she wants but we can calculate her odds and probability based on a few assumptions listed out below. Her best chance to win is to hit in this situation assuming she has a soft 18 versus a face card. A basic deck has 52 cards, with four suits ranging from Ace to King (An ace can be high 11 or 1 in this situation). The dealer also has a card down and the highest probablility of this is for it to be of value ten (Ten-King) which gives us 30% or 16/52. Based on this we assume that if she hits and gets an ace to 3 she has improved her hand and should stay. The probability of Ace-Three  is 12/52 or 23%. Furthermore if she hits and gets a Face card Ten-King her probability of this is 16/52 or 30%. In that case she has a better than 50% to improve or remain in the same position so her best option is to hit. Eventually we can calcualte the odds of each card in the deck for the player and the dealers and this is . Therefore her best option is to hit.* 

Assumptions 

* Soft 18 (Ace, 7) 
* 52 card deck 
* Automatic Shuffler
* Dealers has a Face Card Up 
* Both Players Bust over 21
