1.Your friend is playing blackjack at a casino, and hits on 18. The next card is a 3, and your friend wins $500. The next night, the same situation comes up again, and your friend asks for your advice on whether to hit or stick. What would you tell her?  

*In this case it's called gambling for a reason so she may choose to do what she wants but we can calculate her odds and probability based on a few assumptions listed out below. Her best chance to win is to hit in this situation assuming she has a soft 18, playing with a shuffling machine, and a 4 deck machine.*  

Assumptions 

* Soft 18 (Ace, 7)
